# Arch Installation Script


## Before Installation

The standard Arch image does not come with Git or Ruby, so you need to install it:

```bash
pacman -Sy
pacman -S git ruby
```

## Cloning the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucastercas/arch-install
```


## Fix
1. `Unknown type: swap` when mounting disks
2.
